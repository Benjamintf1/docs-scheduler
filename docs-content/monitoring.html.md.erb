This topic describes the logs and metrics you can use to monitor the health and performance of Pivotal Scheduler. For general information about logging and metrics in Pivotal Platform, see [Logging and Metrics](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/index.html).

## <a id="metrics"></a>Scheduler Metrics

Pivotal Scheduler emits metrics to Loggregator if the `metrics-forwarder` service is bound to the `scheduler` app in the `system` org and `p-scheduler` space.

Pivotal Scheduler emits the following metrics:

| **Data Source** | **Description** | **Metric Unit** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gauge.scheduler.jobs.executed` | The number of jobs Scheduler has executed. | Integer |
| `gauge.scheduler.jobs.failed` | The number of jobs Scheduler failed to execute. | Integer |
| `gauge.scheduler.jobs.rejected` | The number of jobs Scheduler requested the Cloud Controller to execute but failed to start a task. | Integer |
| `gauge.scheduler.jobs.total` | The number of jobs that currently exists in Scheduler. | Integer |
| `gauge.scheduler.calls.executed` | The number of calls Scheduler has executed.  | Integer |
| `gauge.scheduler.calls.failed` | The number of calls Scheduler failed to execute. | Integer |
| `gauge.scheduler.calls.total` | The number of calls that currently exists in Scheduler. | Integer |

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal Metrics Forwarder is unsupported as of Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.5. This functionality is unavailable after upgrading to PAS v2.5 or later. Upgrading to PAS v2.5 does not impact the reliability or health of Pivotal Scheduler.</p>
