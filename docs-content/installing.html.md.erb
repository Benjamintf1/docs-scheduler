Before you install VMware Tanzu Scheduler v2.0, you must have one of the following:

+ A VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs v3.0 or later tile configured to use MySQL 8.0. To download VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs, see [VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/pivotal-mysql/) on VMware Tanzu Network. For information about installing VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs, see [Installing and configuring VMware Tanzu SQL with MySQL for VMs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SQL-with-MySQL-for-Tanzu-Application-Service/2.10/mysql-for-tas/install-config.html). For information about configuring TLS, see [Configure security](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-SQL-with-MySQL-for-Tanzu-Application-Service/2.10/mysql-for-tas/install-config.html#security).

+ An external MySQL v8.0 or later database with TLS deactivated.

      </tr>
      <tr>

    <span class="note__title">Note</span>
    The network selected is used only by Errand VMs and does not apply to the Scheduler runtime.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id="scheduler-config"></a> Configure Scheduler options

1. Click **Scheduler Configuration**.
    * **Enable outbound HTTP calls**:
      This field is activated by default. Deactivate this feature to prevent users from scheduling
      outbound HTTP requests (calls) from the Scheduler service. This does not affect
      outbound connectivity from Diego tasks (jobs).
    * **Database Source > Service Broker**:
      * **Name**
        Enter the name of your MySQL service broker. For example, `p.mysql`.
      * **Plan Name**
        Enter the name of your MySQL service plan, which is used to provision a database for
        persistent storage of Scheduler data, including jobs, calls, and history. For example,
        `db-small`.
    * **Database Source > External**:
        Enter a database URL. It must have a scheme, user, password, host, and port, for example
        `mysql://user:password@db.example.com:3306`. Query parameters are ignored. For example, with
        `mysql://user:password@db.example.com:3306/?useTLS=false`, the query parameter `useTLS` is
        not propagated to Scheduler.
