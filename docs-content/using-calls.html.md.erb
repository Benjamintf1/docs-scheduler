This topic provides instructions for managing outbound HTTP calls in Pivotal Scheduler.

## <a id="manage-calls"></a>Manage Calls

You can use Pivotal Scheduler to schedule execution of HTTP calls to external HTTP services. See the following sections to learn more about creating, running, and scheduling calls and viewing call history.

To use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) for managing calls, you must install the Pivotal Scheduler CLI plugin on your local machine. This plugin is packaged with the Pivotal Scheduler tile on <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-scheduler-for-pcf">Pivotal Network</a>. For more information, see the <a href="using.html#prereqs">Prerequisites</a> section of the Using Pivotal Scheduler topic.

### <a id="create-calls"></a>Create a Call

You can create a call by running the `cf create-call APP-NAME CALL-NAME URL` command, where:

  * `APP-NAME` is the app you want to create a call for.
  * `CALL-NAME` is the name for your call.
  * `URL` is the URL to execute a HTTP POST call against.

### <a id="exec-calls"></a>Execute a Call

You can execute a call manually by running the `cf run-call CALL-NAME` command. This is often useful to test the configuration of a call prior to scheduling it for recurring execution.

See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf run-call my-call<br>
Enqueuing call my-call for app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Call execution must complete within 10 seconds.</p>

### <a id="schedule-call"></a>Schedule a Call

You can schedule a call to execute at any time using a schedule expression. Pivotal Scheduler requires Quartz cron expressions in the `MIN HOUR DAY-OF-MONTH MONTH DAY-OF-WEEK` format. For more information on how to use this syntax, see [Scheduler Cron Syntax](syntax.html).

For example, to execute a call at noon every day, run the following command:

<pre class="terminal">$ cf schedule-call my-call "0 12 ? * * "</pre>

A single call can have multiple schedules. Each schedule has a GUID to distinguish it from similar schedules.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Scheduled calls automatically execute in UTC.</p>

### <a id="list-calls"></a>View Calls

You can use the cf CLI to list all calls in a space by running `cf calls`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf calls<br>
Listing calls for org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
Call Name    App Name        URL
my-call      my-app          https://example.com
OK
</pre>

### <a id="view-schedules"></a>View Schedules for Calls

You can review schedules for all calls in a space by running `cf call-schedules`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf call-schedules <br>
Getting scheduled calls for org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
App Name: my-app
my-call    2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d   0 12 ? * *
OK
</pre>

### <a id="call-history"></a>View Call History

You can review call history by running `cf call-history CALL-NAME`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf call-history my-call<br>
Getting scheduled call history for my-call in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...

### <a id="delete-call"></a>Delete a Call

You can delete a call by running `cf delete-call CALL-NAME`. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-call my-call<br>
Really delete the call my-call with url https://example.com and all associated schedules and history?> [yN]:y
OK
</pre>

### <a id="delete-schedule"></a>Delete a Call Schedule

You can delete a specific schedule by running `cf delete-call-schedule SCHEDULE-GUID`, where `SCHEDULE-GUID` is the GUID found in the output of the `cf call-schedules` command. See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf delete-call-schedule 2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d<br>
Really delete the schedule 2b69e0c2-9664-46bb-4817-54afcedbb65d / 0 12 ? * * and all associated history?> [yN]: y
OK
</pre>
